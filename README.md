## This is a leetcode clone, looks nothing like it, mainly focused on backend
Code submission is in development

If you want to contribute to the frontend kindly follow the rules as follows:
1. For CSS, id or class of a tag should be named as {pagename-actualid}, For example id="Home-loginbutton".
2. All CSS should be written under the index.css file present in ./client/src/index.css.

NOTE: Please do not change anything in the server directory or anything related to backend in the client directory(api routes, http requests ...etc).
